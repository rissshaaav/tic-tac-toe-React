# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game created using React. The game is designed for two players to play against each other. Players can choose between playing as X or O.

## Getting Started
To get started with the game, simply click on the "Play" button on the welcome screen. The game will then prompt the players to enter their names and select a symbol (X or O) for themselves. Once the players have made their selections, they can start playing the game.

## Game Rules
The rules of the game are simple. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the game board. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the squares on the board are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.
